My professional journey to-date has been fun and interesting overall.  I studied English,
Business, and Film at UCLA after dropping out of my Computer Science and Engineering major there
since I was having a challenging time with my early CS class.  I didn't have much of a strong CS
background though I have always loved technical realms like video games, the web, etc.  Ever since
I was a kid, I wanted to make movies and so I stepped into my American Literature and Culture major
and performed well there and truly loved it.

However, when I graduated from college, I had to get a job and I happened to &apos;long story short,&apos;
I fell into Finance and did surprisingly well.  I traded Commodities at a Futures Commission
Merchant near LA and grew my book of business.  Still, I wasn't pleased with the overall philosophy
of the company where I worked and I went to work for a few more Commodity brokerage firms in LA.
None of these firms matched my overall philosophy so I moved to Oregon and left Finance as an employee,
and strategized to launch my own Commodity brokerage firm and Commodity Trading Advisor.

I performed well, yet had some rocky market experiences here and there as well and I made some strategic
business mistakes as well.  Hence, I took a few leaves of absence to go after a few more entrepreneurial
ventures, both in hardware and marketing, etc. What I learned was that I want to make sure that I am at
the helm of a startup (as opposed to being second fiddle) and that currently I love building two
businesses, one in private education called <a href="http://www.learnhall.com" target="_blank">Learnhall</a> and one in
Commodity trading called <a href="http://www.likeahedgefund.com" target="_blank">LikeAHedgeFund</a>.  Both are businesses
that can grow and scale with a founder who possesses exemplary technical skills.  My last venture had a
technical co-founder, yet I misread his ambition level. Hence, this is why I am here at
<a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>. I also wish to have these tech skills so that I can
be nimble in the future with regards to my professional career and goals as I might have other ventures
that I wish to build down the road.

What I especially love about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">
coding</a> is it can help me as a tech entrepreneur.  While I might be interested in the
right opportunity as an employee, I mostly wish to learn coding so that I can seek to grow my startups and
try to succeed well in the business world and have staying power in said world.  I love learning and solving real
problems in the business world and I believe that tech skills learned at LC will help me throughout the rest of
my life.
